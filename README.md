# Mu-SHROOM
Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes

# What This Project is About

This project is about building a system that can spot and address issues in text generated by large language models (LLMs). Sometimes, these models produce text that sounds good but contains incorrect or unsupported information. This is called "hallucination." Our goal is to work with a dataset from SEMEVAL-2025 to improve how we detect and fix these issues, especially across different languages.

# Why Weâ€™re Doing This

# The main reasons for this project are:

 - To understand how hallucinations happen in texts written in multiple languages.

 - To create machine learning tools that can highlight and fix these mistakes.

 - To make text generated by LLMs more accurate and trustworthy.

# Tools used

Languages: Python.

Frameworks:

 - transformers for working with pre-trained models.

 - torch for training and building machine learning models.

Development Environment: Visual Studio Code for writing and running the code.

Other Tools:

 - Libraries like numpy and pandas for working with data.

 - Matplotlib for visualizing results.
